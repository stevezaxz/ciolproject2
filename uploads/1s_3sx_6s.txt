"1s 3s 6s" lyrics:

What you do makes you
Who define you refine you
What you feel molds you into
I choose to take chances
Be thrilled to just gamble for the surprises
Whatever the prices whatever it offers
To witness what it teaches

It’s everything or otherwise turns
You’ve lost stolen from you or wasted
Stand up learn from it embrace
The lessons turns you’ve found gained
You have been given live each moment
If it was your last minute throw
If only i had those turns that i have longed
I would not have been this cold

What you do makes you
Who define you refine you
What you feel molds you into

Even with countless walls
Loose ends or dead ends
And this discontentment
Over my share of luck
Still i threw them into the air
Wishes wrapped with prayers

It’s everything or otherwise turns
You’ve lost stolen from you or wasted
Stand up learn from it embrace
The lessons turns you’ve found gained
You have been given live each moment
If it was your last minute throw
If only i had those turns that i have longed
I would not have been this cold

Bound to reveal the hidden
Unravel the package
Meant for the wounded and the puzzled

For the wounded and the puzzled
